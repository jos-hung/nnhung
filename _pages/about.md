# Professional Background

I am now a Ph.D student at Department of Electrical and Information Technology. Previously, I was a senior AI engineer at FPT Software, and before this, I served as a senior software engineer at LG Electronics. I obtained my engineering degree from Hanoi University of Science and Technology in 2018. In 2023, I completed my Master's in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Hanyang University, Ansan, Korea.

My research interests lie in the realm of software engineering, particularly within the fields of edge/cloud computing and computer systems. In addition, my primary focuses include greedy algorithms, graph theory, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL).

# Lecturer at Phenikaa University

I am a faculty member at School of Computing Phenikaa University, Yen Nghia, Ha Dong, Hanoi. I am excited to work with my dear co-workers and students here.

# Research Journey

I started my research journey as a student at Hanoi University of Science and Technology. I worked with my labmate at the Motor Design Lab under the supervision of Prof. [Bui Minh Dinh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=lACArY4AAAAJ) and the Chemical Processing Lab under the guidance of Prof. [Nguyen Dang Binh Thanh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uu5VPhcAAAAJ&hl=vi&oi=sra). Here, I did research in numerical methods, computer systems, and motor design. This research then led me to receive third place in the student research competition at Hanoi University of Science and Technology.

I was a master's student at Hanyang University in Electronics under the supervision of Prof. [Sang-Woon Jeon](https://sites.google.com/view/icl-lab/team/professor?authuser=0). Thanks to Prof. Jeon's guidance, I developed a deeper understanding of research concepts and writing skills. During this time, I also explored AI fields, especially deep reinforcement learning, Markovian decision processes, and cloud systems which were instrumental in the completion of my [thesis](https://repository.hanyang.ac.kr/handle/20.500.11754/188311).

# Research Interests

The problem of Mobile Edge Computing and related issues attract me.

# Current Works

Currently, I am a key member of the quantization teams at AI Center, FPT Software. This project has helped me gain a better understanding of AI compilers, model compression, and quantization.

In addition, my collaboration with Prof. [Van-Dinh Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wgsX_zIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) has allowed me to continue my interest in edge/cloud areas. The work is updated at [ITS research works](https://github.com/ngochungnguyenlg/ITS_paper).

# Activity
I have completed 14 peer reviews for the following publications:

- Computer Networks Journal (Q1, Elsevier)
- IEEE Internet of Things Journal (Q1, IEEE)
- IEEE Communications Letters (Q1, IEEE)

# Collaboration

I am delighted to work with my best friend, [Nguyen Van Thieu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thieu1995/). Assistant Prof. Nguyen Van Dinh is my kind brother, and advisor.
